# Python_Head-Count-Detection
Developed a Python Head-Count Detection &amp; Alert System using YOLOv8 and OpenCV to detect and count people from images. Designed a Tkinter-based GUI for visualizing detection results with bounding boxes, and implemented threshold-based alert mechanisms including desktop notifications and automated email alerts for real-time monitoring and safety.
